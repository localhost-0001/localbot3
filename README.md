# localbot3 (python edition/mistake)

A crappy Discord bot made in [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

## DO NOT USE THIS, IT'S OLD, OUTDATED, BAD WRITTEN, BUGGY, AND OUTDATED 

## Getting Started

These instructions will show you how not to set up and not get localbot3 running

### Prerequisites

First, you need to install [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).
After that, you would need to install v 0.16.smth of https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py


You can't. [OK, I lied.](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/releases/tag/v0.16.12) Gl. 


### Installing

Fill out the SECRETS.py, config.py

To run the bot, use following command in the command line 
```
./main.sh
```

## Built With

* [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - It's a programming language
* [Rapptz/discord.py (v 0.16.smth)](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) - API used, bot doesn't use the current version

## Authors

* **localhost#0001** - *throwing the thing together* - [localhost-0001](https://github.com/localhost-0001)

See also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/localhost-0001/localbot3/contributors) who participated in this project.

## License

Coded everything myself to ask following question: What license? Just use it if you want. I won't sue you. Just don't say you coded all this yourself.
